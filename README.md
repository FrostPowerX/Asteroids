# Asteroids
 Epic Space Game
 
Here I bring you a new game, inspired by Asteroids, comes Capsule Reaper.
Here you will have to destroy all the viruses that have contaminated your body by controlling a miniature ship that shoots capsules that eliminate the viruses while you upgrade your ship!
Destroy as many viruses as you can! and be careful... those who injected you with the virus will not allow you to continue destroying them!
